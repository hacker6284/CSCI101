    f = file( filename, "a" )
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'helluva/engineer.txt'

D: It created the file in the parent directory of CSCI101, Documents

E: It had to interact with the Documents folder, CSCI101 folder, and helluva folder. It probably started in CSCI101, followed .. to Documents, went back to CSCI101, then to helluva.
